# Gridfinity Containers

Jigit can be used to build electronics storage containers for
[Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/), the popular open source grid storage system.
The cool thing about is that almost the entire workflow happens in your favourite
electronic design software, [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/).  KiCAD comes with a
huge library of parts. For components you use, you probably already have your
footprints and symbols defined. With Jigit you can build storage containers for
any of them, in any combination and more.

As an example, here is a gridfinity container that can hold eight 10 pin headers:

Gridfinity works on a grid of 42 mm x 42 mm for the baseplate. A single gridfinity
container is a rounded 41.5 mm square. See the
[specification](https://gridfinity.xyz/specification/) for details.

Jigs generated by jigit may be thought of as a storage container for a set of
electronic components.  The gridfinity container shape can be modelled as a PCB
shape.  The components you need to "store" in the container are placed on the
PCB as desired. Here is one sample layout for a gridfinity container that can
hold ten 1x10 pin standard(2.54mm pitch) headers:

Generating the Jig is a simple matter as usual:

    jigit \
      -i gridfinity-1x1/gridfinity-1x1.kicad_pcb \
      -c gridfinity.toml \
      -o jigs/gridfinity-1x1.3mf

Do refer to the settings in the configuration file
[gridfinity.toml](gridfinity.toml).

The resultant jig lacks the gridfinity base.  This needs to be merged in
to create a complete gridfinity container.

[Gridfinity Generator](https://gridfinity.perplexinglabs.com/pr/gridfinity-rebuilt/0/0)
provides a convenient way to generate gridfinity compatible base designs.
Setting height to 1 mm provides a convenient building block with an almost
flat top.

I have download and saved this file as
[base/base-gridfinity-1x1.stl](base/base-gridfinity-1x1.stl).

To merge the models, let's fire up the slicer (Prusa Slicer in my case).
First we'll load the base model.  Then we'll right click on the model,
choose "Add Part...", then "Load". Then we'll select the generated jig file.
The jig will get added at unexpected positions. You'll need to match the
position (X, Y) of the jig to the base model. Then change the Z value to
make the generated jig "sit" on the base container. With the right values,
you'll end up with this:

You can now print the resulting file, or save it, say as
[containers/gridfinity-container-8x10pin-header.stl](containers/gridfinity-container-8x10pin-header.stl). There you have it - gridfinity containers
for your own components are just a few minutes away.

I use FreeCAD with the 
[KiCAD StepUp mod](https://www.kicad.org/external-tools/stepup/) workbench for
drawing the PCB outlines to the correct dimension and shape. The container
shapes are in
[gridfinity-container-shapes.FCStd](gridfinity-container-shapes.FCStd)
