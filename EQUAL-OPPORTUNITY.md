jigit saves you time, material and money. jigit is an "equal opportunity"
 tool. It is developed by Shree Kumar (shree.shree@gmail.com).

You (individual user, teacher/school/user group, company etc) are obligated to
compensate the developer fairly, determined by you (and not by the developer
of the tool), in a convenient time frame, based on your usage. Note that this
is an obligation. While "compensation" is not limited to money, but that is the
easiest; read on for more possibilities.

Your contribution supports the development, continued availability, support,
enhancement and maintenance of jigit.

# Compensating the Developer

There are three ways you may "compensate" the developer:

 1. Pay a fair price determined by you directly to the developer. It is recommended
    that you do this at-least once for every six months of your usage of the tool.
 2. Propose a "barter", mentioning what value you have derived and what you propose
    as exchange of value. If the developer accepts the barter, then your dues are
    considered paid for the time period under consideration. This is explained in
    detail later.
 3. "Educational" license. In this case, you can generate a report stating how
    you/your group/institution has been using the software, what you estimate it's
    value to be and send it to the developer. This needs to be done for every 6
    months of your usage of the tool.

Note that compensating the developer does not result in a commercial support
agreement. If you are in need of such an arrangement, please contact the developer.
Note that you are compensating the developer for value already derived by you,
and not for something that the developer may/may not do in the future. For specific
needs (useful for commercial use and support), please contact the developer by email.

<u>**Direct payment**</u>: Please use the
[github sponsors page of the developer](https://github.com/sponsors/shreekumar3d),
and pay the fair price as determined by you.  If this is not convenient, let the
developer know by email.

<u>**Barter**</u>: Here are some simple ideas: you can help translate the software,
promotion, gifts, documentation/examples, graphic design, and anything else you can come
up with - which you think may be of value to the developer. This is not an exhaustive
list, and thus left to your creativity. This obviously involves more effort
than direct payment, and time as well. Barters must be proposed by sending an email
to the developer. Note that till the developer agrees to the barter, your obligation
stands.

<u>**Education**</u>: Educational license applies to institutions, groups, and educators.

<u>**Individual Education**</u>: You may use the tool for your own education, and send
me a report of value every six months, provided you are under 23 years of age.  All
personal educational use under 18 years of age does not need a report. Parents/guardians
using the tool in such contexts (under 18 years) are exempt from sending such reports.
The developer would appreciate it (as it is encouraging!), but that is not an obligation.

# LICENSE

Apart from the obligations mentioned above, this software is licensed under
the AGPL 3.0 LICENSE, included in this repository. In terms of licensing, the
"obligation to pay a fair price" (as outlined above) is the "price" that you
agree to pay for use of the software. If you are a software developer or anybody
who uses the source code of this tool, then please read till the end of this
document to get a complete picture of all your obligations.

# Equal Opportunity

jigit is useful across education, hobbyists/makers, DIY, professionals and
industry. Naturally, the value that you derive from the tool depends on many
factors including your nature of use, location in the world and derived
economic value.  Given the wide variety of situations in which this tool
could potentially be deployed, the developers do not fix a price.

Why? Fixing a price will certainly result in denying somebody the opportunity
to use the tool. Thus, you are expected to assess the value yourself.

The tools internally compute data related to usage. This data does not identify
you, and is not shared across the network, except when you choose to do it
yourself. The level of usage is visible in the user interface anytime for you
to evaluate the utility of the tool. You may use this information to compensate
the developer at any time, or periodically.  Do note that continued usage is
a reliable indicator that you are finding the tool useful and that it is adding
value.

You are encouraged to make a monetary contribution. If we do not provide a
payment mechanism that works for you, please contact the developer for additional
options. Note that we do not accept crypto tokens.

Jigit supports the cause of education. Education is a bedrock of modern
knowledge based society. Education creates opportunities, kickstarting
a virtuous cycle of prosperity. Unfortunately, costs of education are rising
world wide. Jigit does not want to add to such costs. Jigit may be used without
charge for education, provided you meet some requirements (mentioned above).
A mention of jigit in any reports you generate would be nice, as well as other
forms of credit - including, but not limited to social media mentions. We are
always happy to see what you do with it and how it helps!

No timeline is fixed for compensating the developer. However, this does
not free you from the obligation of fair compensation. If you are
unable to compensate the developer in a reasonable timeline (nominally, 6 months
after you start using the software), then please contact the developer, helpfully
explaining your situation and requesting options.

As mentioned above, compensation is not necessarily monetary. To support the
cause of equal opportunity arround the world, the developer needs to make this
software usable in many more languages.  If this is an area where you can
help, checkout the CONTRIBUTING file.  You only need a practical working knowledge
of languages for this.

For a broader understanding of why "Equal Opportunity" matters, and how it is
different from other approaches, see [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md)

# Note for Software Developers

If you are a software developer, then you may find many things of value
in the source code.  Techniques and algorithms. You may build additional tools
and call them your own. Any value you derive from the source code itself also
is something that falls under your "obligation" of repayment. Again, the value of
this is assessed by you.

Finally, the developer strongly recommends that you continue the chain of
"equal opportunity" when you share the source code in any form with others.
That way you can ensure the sustainable development of the tool.
