This directory contains a minimal "hello" example.  It's a PCB with a single
2 pin berg header and an M3 mounting hole.

The "gen" subdirectory contains example outputs from various commands, ready to
use with your slicer, FreeCAD and OpenSCAD. This can be used for demonstration
and learning.  There is no need to install JigIt to try these out - you only
need the tools that open the relevant files.
