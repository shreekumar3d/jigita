This directory contains pre-generated outputs corresponding to the test design
hello.kicad-pcb.  All the commands shown below are run from the root of the
source code base, thus they contain relative paths.

hello-kicad.step is an export of the PCB file from KiCAD, with the "Coordinates"
value set to "Grid Origin".

hello-jig.stl is a jig generated with default parameters (and in 3D printing
orientation), with the following command:

    jigit -i test-boards/hello/hello.kicad_pcb -o test-boards/hello/gen/hello-jig.stl

hello-jig-step-coord.stl is the same jig, but it is in the same coordinate system
as hello-kicad.step. It is generated as follows:

    jigit --keep-orientation -i test-boards/hello/hello.kicad_pcb -o test-boards/hello/gen/hello-jig-step-coord.stl

hello-jig-on-board.FCStd is a freecad file that includes hello-kicad.step and
hello-jig-step-coord.stl in the same file.  This allows you to understand the
relative positioning among the various elements with a user interface.

hello-jig.scad is the configuratble OpenSCAD output generated by jigit, using
the following command:

    jigit -i test-boards/hello/hello.kicad_pcb -o test-boards/hello/gen/hello-jig.scad

hello-jig.scad can be opened in OpenSCAD.  With OpenSCAD, you you can tweak
the model parameters interactively, generate 3D models, print and iterate.
