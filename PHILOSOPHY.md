"Equal opportunity" software is how I have started to call some of my selected
works. This term has one key difference from common FOSS/FLOSS, or the commonly
used term: "Open Source". "Equal opportunity" is heavily influenced by those ideas.
From a pure software licensing point of view, "equal opportunity" just uses
standard FOSS licenses.

The difference is in how I use the word "free". Specifically, "Equal opportunity"
is not "free" software. Users need to pay a fair price. Software tools cost
developer expertise and time to develop. The ecosystem is evolutionary in nature,
requiring periodic work even just to keep up with it. Useful tools may be "free",
but that just means somebody or the other paid in some form for it. Using a term
such as "free" may be confusing if it fails to convey the real needs of the
developers behind a project.

Many standard "free" software licenses focus on maintaining 4 "freedoms":

1. The freedom to run the program for any purpose
2. The freedom to distribute exact copies of the program
3. The freedom to study and change the program's source code
4. The freedom to distribute modified versions of the program

F3 and F4 are mostly related to the internal implementation of the tools.
Most users of a tool (including developers) don't need to look at the
internal details of a tool most of the time. Seamless software distribution
mechanisms allow software tools to be downloaded and used directly (this wasn't
always true!). Thus the most exercised "freedom" that is the focus of "free"
software is F1 (heavily used - run), followed by F2 (software providers). F3 and
F4 are used by a much smaller subset of people. Exercising such freedoms
requires significant knowledge, time and specific tools. Yet, they are the reason
why we have such a rich ecosystem of "free" (as in zero cost) tools - ready to use
at any time, for any purpose.

For the vast majority of users - "free" software is a zero cost tool. That is
the primary benefit. That is no small benefit. Commercial software requires
license purchases. With the internet economy, tools may be subsidized by monetizing
data, and directly/indirectly showing "ads". Web based tools ("SaaS") can offer
significant functionality for non-commercial users. In the minds of the general
user, "free" tends to become a reference to cost. All these have given us a
scenario where end users just use whatever tools are available to them,
preferring "no cost" tools for that benefit alone. Harping on the four freedoms
is not useful, as it entirely fails to get across the point.

My argument is that usage of the word "free" to describe the software is the
biggest impediment to make users of such software pay for it. FAQs of software
license documents routinely include phrases such as "free as in free speech",
"free as in freedom", and 'not free as in "free beer"'. Freedom for who ? Such
freedoms are exercised only by a small fraction of the userbase.  For the
remaining users, "free" means just one thing: zero cost to get and use the
software. Riding on the back of "free", software finds wide adoption.
Friction starts when developers start asking users to pay. Monetization
done as an afterthought is difficult, as users get used to zero cost.

"Equal opportunity" is a somewhat different approach. I argue that the
primary benefit we offer to users is economic opportunity.  It's a tool and
nothing more. By allowing users to pay a fair price, evaluated by them, rather
than by us the developers, I offer everyone a fair choice. By not placing
aggressive time limits, I ensure that even people who may otherwise use the
software sparingly are not unnecessarily burdened. I place the users in control
of evaluating value, and the price they are willing to pay for that value.
By not letting them equate it to "0 cost", I hope to avoid the pitfalls
that many "free" software developers invariably face.

By making "compensation" an obligation, I appeal to their human values, not an
adherance to a legal framework. I believe this is important in a globalized
world. Reliance on a legal framework may or may not necessarily work worldwide.

This is fair both to the users and the developers of the tool. A 6 month chunk for
evaluation of value places low burden, and promotes sustainability.

Finally, my "barter" compensation method is heavily inspired from a past where
community meant helping each other out.  So many things used to be exchanged for
"free" - no money exchanged hands yet people would keep tab of favours due and
received.  It was not blemishless, but it did promote a feeling of community,
and highlighted dependence. I argue that barter would work better in the digital
age.

Yeah, and that's the beauty of the scheme.  You either trade money or time. Your
choice, not mine.  If you can't pay me, I can accumulate favours of my choice.
If you use this in education, I get to know how it's being used there and how
it is adding value. That could be satisfying indeed. All in all, pretty good,
isn't it ?

Finally, the idea of calling the software "Equal opportunity" is inspired by
where I can come from. I could call it the land of "Free Food". This is the area of
Dakshina Kannada District of Karnataka State in India. If you have been there,
you might have noticed that many temples serves lunch every single day. I have
donated many times  to temples, though my beliefs don't necessarily
match theirs. Why ? I believe it's a good system, and contributing to it is the
best way of sustaining it. Some contribute in cash, some contribute in kind. This
allows them to serve free food to everybody who comes - ranging in scale from
100s, or 1000s and more every day, sustainably. For all practical intents and
purposes, it is "free food". But they don't term it "free", and they don't call
it "food". They call it "prasad" - an offering to gods. By appealing to the
highest possible purpose, they achieve good outcomes. That's what I hope to
achieve too.

Lastly, I need to address the biggest elephant in the room : "Scale". I strongly
believe that the intent of "free" licenses is the most important guiding light.
What were they trying to achieve ? Let's look at nature for inspiration. If you
notice in a forest, you will find trees of varying height. Great forests have
great trees. Do they vary much in height ? Now look at the economic conditions
of fellow humans. Orders of magnitude ? FOSS done right should contribute to a
forest tree height distribution.

Can "equal opportunity" fix this problem at scale ? I am not naive to believe
that it can. I can hope, for sure. Luckily for me, if this template works for
everyone, me included, at the scale of Jigit, that's enough for me, to begin with!
