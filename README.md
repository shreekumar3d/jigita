# Jig It!

Ease PCB assembly with automatically generated 3D printed jigs. Achieve well aligned connectors. No motor skills required.

JigIt is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 License. If you need to work with electronics, it can help you save time, material
and money. Should you find value in this tool, the author implores you to take on the moral obligation of abiding by
the "Equal Opportunity" manifesto. Details of what "equal opportunity" means and your obligations are in

Starting with a PCB design, JigIt achieves this workflow:

 1. Create a 3D printable jig design from a PCB design.
 2. Print jig.
 3. Mount components and PCB on jig. If tolerance issues, tweak parameters, goto step 1.
 4. Solder away for perfect results... every time !
